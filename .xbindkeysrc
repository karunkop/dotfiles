# To identify a key, you can run 'xbindkeys --key' or
# 'xbindkeys --multikey' in a terminal
# and put one of the two output lines in this file.

# Mod4 is also known as the Super or Windows key.
#
# The release modifier is not a standard X modifier, but you can
# use it if you want to catch release events instead of press events.
#
# By default, xbindkeys does not pay attention to the modifiers
# NumLock, CapsLock and ScrollLock.
# Uncomment the lines below if you want to pay attention to them.
#
#keystate_numlock = enable
#keystate_capslock = enable
#keystate_scrolllock= enable

# NOTE xbindkeys reloads its configuration file each time it has changed.
# If you want to force it to reload its configuration file,
# you can send a HUP signal:
#       killall -HUP xbindkeys

# Or if that's not enough, a full restart:
#       pkill -x xbindkeys
#       xbindkeys_autostart

# (Sometimes this is needed.)
# When a HUP signal is sent to xbindkeys,
# changes in $HOME/.xbindkeysrc take effect only after moving the mouse.
